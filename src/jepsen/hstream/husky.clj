;; Parameters:
;; 1. max-streams
;; 2. max-keys
;; 3. max-write-number
;; 4. read-wait-time
;; 5. read-number
;; 6. freq

;; Generates a series of hstream operators with abundant randomness.
;; There are 4 types of operators:
;; [write  s_i] {:type :invoke :f :add  :value _        :stream s_i :key _}
;; [sub    s_i] {:type :invoke :f :sub                  :stream s_i}
;; [read   s_i] {:type :invoke :f :read :consumer-id _  :stream s_i}
;; [create s_i] {:type :invoke :f :create               :create :stream s_i}

;; There are some restrictions:
;; 1. There is **exactly 1** [create s_i] operator before any [write s_i], [sub
;; s_i] or [read s_i].
;; 2. There is **exactly 1** [sub s_i] operator before any [read s_i].
;; 3. There is **no** [write s_i] (read-wait-time/freq) seconds after a [read
;; s_i].
